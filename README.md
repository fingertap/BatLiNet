# Official Implementation for BatLiNet

This repository provide the complete code for reproducing the results of paper "Accurate battery lifetime prediction across diverse aging conditions with deep learning".

**_NOTE:_** To build features for `MIX-100`, you will need at least 128 GB memory. Also, to achieve efficiency, you need at least one GPU device for feature smoothing and learning algorithm.

## Environment Setup

We recommend using the image [fingertap/nmi_reproduction](#) that contains all the necessary libraries for reproduction. Please refer to the [dockerfile](Dockerfile) for details.

To start from a fresh installation of Ubuntu with GPU, first install [conda](#) and create a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n nmi_reproduction
conda activate nmi_reproduction
```

Install PyTorch following the [official instructions](#) and then install the rest dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset preparation

In our experiments, we used the following public datasets:

- MATR-1
- MATR-2
- SNL
- UL_PUR
- CLO
- HNEI
- RWTH
- CALCE

Simply run the following script to download the raw data files and preprocess them:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
python scripts/download.py --output-path ./data/raw
python scripts/preprocess.py --input-path ./data/raw --output-path ./data/processed
```

## Experiment Reproduction

We run all our experiments by providing a config file to our CLI tool. You can find all the config files [here](configs/). To accelerate training and evaluation, as well as reducing the memory footprint, you can first build the cache for all configs:

```bash
./scripts/build_cache.sh
```

This will load the datasets and build features for different configs with different train-test split, feature definition, etc.

To run a single config file, substitude the file path to the config file you would like to run and execute the following command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/pipeline.py YOUR_CONFIG_FILE --train True --evaluate True
```

To run a config with $n$ seeds starting from 0, run the following command:

```bash
./scripts/run_pipeline_with_n_seeds.sh YOUR_CONFIG_FILE NUMBER_OF_SEEDS
```

To run all experirments sequentially (for a complete reproduction of our experiments), use the following command:

```bash
./scripts/run_all_configs.sh
```

## Figures and Tables

We provide the code for plotting the figures and tables in [fig&tab.ipynb](fig&tab.ipynb).
